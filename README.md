# Developer-Task

This project is a simple Java application for managing tasks and devs. Each task is assigned to a developer but it needs to have the necessary skill level to be assigned to a task. The task can have a status of pending or completed. The project uses entities to represent tasks and developers, and services to manage these entities.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new developers and tasks at localStorage.
- **Read:** Retrieve information about developers and tasks from the local Storage.
- **Update:** Modify existing developers and tasks details.
- **Delete:** Remove developers and tasksfrom the local storage.
- **Skill System:** The developers only can be assigned to a task if them have the same or higher skill level of the task.
